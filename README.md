## DDQN_PongDeterministic-v4
Use DDQN model to do reinforcement learning on Atari Pong-s

Score started at 100 episodes
## Environment
The .ipynb file can be correctly run on Google Colab, but it took a lot of time and may can't reach the final result.
* GPU:Tesla T4(16GB) * 1
* CPU: 8 vCPU Intel Xeon Processor (Skylake, IBRS)
* RAM:56GB

## Final results
The DDQN model finally beat the computer from Episodes 125, but it took about 50 hours to acheive this stage.Since the time limit, we stopped training at this moment.
